# tweet-skimmer

This is a quick node.js script that generates an RSS feed of a user's timeline without replies or retweets. Call it like this:

	/timeline?name=[username w/o @]

It gets the user's most recent tweets by scraping the website. You don't need a Twitter account or an API key.
  
Happy tweet skimming!
